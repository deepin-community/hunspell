Description: spell checker and morphological analyzer (development)
 Hunspell is a spell checker and morphological analyzer library and program
 designed for languages with rich morphology and complex word compounding or
 character encoding. It is based on MySpell and features an Ispell-like
 terminal interface using Curses library, an Ispell pipe interface and an
 OpenOffice.org UNO module.
 .
 Main features:
  - Unicode support (first 65535 Unicode characters)
  - morphological analysis (in custom item and arrangement style)
  - Max. 65535 affix classes and twofold affix stripping (for agglutinative
    languages, like Azeri, Basque, Estonian, Finnish, Hungarian, Turkish, etc.)
  - Support complex compoundings (for example, Hungarian and German)
  - Support language specific algorithms (for example, handling Azeri
    and Turkish dotted i, or German sharp s)
  - Handling conditional affixes, circumfixes, fogemorphemes,
    forbidden words, pseudoroots and homonyms.
 .
 This package contains the headers and the static library.
